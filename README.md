# Interactive_UMAP
 Interactive UMAP for manipulation of Parameters

Interactive GUI tSNE & UMAP
Overview
This R code is an interactive GUI to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions using the UMAP and tSNE algorithms. It allows users to upload their own data and play around with various parameters to generate 2D and 3D scatterplots that can be manipulated to help identify patterns and relationships within the data. The code is written in R and leverages various R packages such as ggplot2, UMAP, Plotly, and Shiny.

Requirements
The following R packages must be installed prior to running the code:

ggplot2
hrbrthemes
tidyverse
dplyr
wesanderson
RColorBrewer
manipulate
umap
plotly
shiny
leaflet
mice
VIM
GGally
tidymodels
yardstick
mosaic
Rtsne
Running the Code
The first step is to upload a .csv file containing the data to be analyzed. The code will then calculate and visualize the UMAP and tSNE results using ggplot2 and Plotly. The results can be saved as .csv files and manipulated interactively in the 2D and 3D scatterplots generated by the code.
